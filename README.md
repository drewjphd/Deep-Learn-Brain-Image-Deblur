# Deep-Learn-Brain-Image-Deblur
Sharpening brain image using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python PyTorch

Trains the CNN with 19 sharp and blurred pairs of images. Then tests with a single blur image for comparison with the corresponding sharp. Results presented on my LinkedIn featured section.
